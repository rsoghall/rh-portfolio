Hello,

This is my Portfolio website. I have had extensive experience in the IT industry over the last 24 years. Throughout the years, clients have often asked me to develop their websites or create Apps. In 2017, I decided to start focusing on Web Development. I was self-taught for a couple years making progress, but slowly. In 2019 I completed the DevMountain Immersive Web Development Course. I enjoyed the fast pace learning and studying 10 - 12 hours a day. While at DevMountain, I developed the website dianneadair.org for my person project and shiftradr.com as a group project. Dianne Adair Enrichment Programs is one of my clients who have asked me to development their website. They have 10 daycare centers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. So, my little personal project at DevMountain has turned into a fully developed production website with databases, calendars, email, and login components. Since completing the DevMountain course. I have developed two production websites and currently in the process of working on two more websites for my clients.

Websites/App Currently being Developed:

    NebcoSales.com
        Sales Rep Company in the San Francisco Bay Area. They would like a website which provides information to their clients about the products they represent and also allows the client to place purchase orders online. Sending the purchase orders to the Sales Rep via email.

    HLG-LLP.com
        Law Office in the San Francisco Bay Area specializing in Taxes and Estate Planning. Their current website is in Word Press and does not allow them flexibility in the design and function of the website. I am re-designing their website and adding login and database functionality so clients can login and retrieve their documents or upload documents securely in lieu of emailing the documents.

    A1c-Calculator APP
        I am diabetic and have not found and App out there that I like to keep track of my daily Blood Glucose Numbers. Based on my numbers, the App also calculates my A1c level each day. I usually have to wait until I see a doctor and have an A1c blood test. My last A1c test result number provided by a doctor was 7.4. At the same time, my A1c-Calulator App was 7.7. I started this App while at DevMountain and recently picked it back up and have been working on it for the last couple months. The App is almost ready for production.

     Additonal content to be added to my portfolio website:

        1. "Contact Me" section.
        2. Description of both IT and Web Development Skills
        3. List of Clients and Testimonials.
