                            I have always loved to build and fix things. After 24 years of experience in the IT industry, 
                            and repeated requests from clients to build websites and/or apps, I discovered a new passion 
                            for coding. Iâ€™m excited to announce that I can now offer a full-service IT experience for all 
                            of your web development needs.
